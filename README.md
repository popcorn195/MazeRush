# 🌀 MazeRush

> **MazeRush** is a **pixel-art themed maze visualizer and race simulator** where multiple maze-solving algorithms compete head-to-head.  
> Designed for learners and enthusiasts, it blends **education**, **experimentation**, and **retro-styled gameplay** into one interactive platform.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 🎓 **Learn** how classic maze-generation and maze-solving algorithms work through step-by-step animations.  
- ⚡ **Compare algorithms** in real time with the **Race Mode** — watch two solvers compete visually and chronometrically.  
- 🕹️ **Engage users** with a pixel-art aesthetic that makes algorithm visualization fun and intuitive.  
- 🧩 **Encourage experimentation** by letting users choose algorithms, speeds, and maze sizes.

## 🌟 Features

- 🧱 **Multiple Maze Generation Algorithms**  
  Prim’s, Kruskal’s, Recursive Division, Eller's, and DFS-based generators.

- 🤖 **Multiple Maze Solvers**  
  BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*, Greedy BFS, Dead-End Filling, and Wall Follower.

- 🏁 **Race Mode**  
  Two solvers race live on dual canvases — shows winner and loser with timing stats.

- 🧠 **Learn Mode**  
  Interactive explanations and visualizations of how each algorithm works.

- 🎮 **Game Mode**  
  Playable mazes where you control a player and navigate the generated maze.

- ⏸️ **Pause & Speed Controls**  
  Adjust algorithm speed or pause any visualization mid-run.

- 🧑‍💻 **Modular Architecture**  
  Separate JS modules for algorithms, visualization, and controls.
